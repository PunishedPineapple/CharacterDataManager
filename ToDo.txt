***** TODO LIST *****

High Priority:



Low Priority / Cleanup:

- Can we set the entry in the list box to be unselectable for the character in the combo box, or do we need to just let it happen and only handle ignoring it when actually copying files?  Seems we can't make it readonly really, can we handle indices with a missing item?  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2438168/winforms-listbox-with-readonly-disabled-items


Very Low Priority / Potential New Features:

- Can we have it subscribe to file changes and automatically copy while open?
